"""Render-for-scanning: reads `kustomize build deploy/kind` on stdin and
writes the same manifests with each Argo Rollout re-expressed as a
Deployment carrying the identical pod template. Checkov and Trivy only
evaluate native workload kinds, so without this the Rollout — the one
object that actually runs the image — would be silently skipped and the
scan would pass vacuously. The rewritten file is only scanned, never
applied."""
